# Multi-text-Text-Classification
Build ML model based on Text classification to predict the industry based on job title column 

## Overview & Background
### Industry Classification Problem
You can think of the job industry as the category or general field in which you work. On a job application, "industry" refers to a broad category under which a number of job titles can fall. For example, sales is an industry; job titles under this category can include sales associate, sales manager, manufacturing sales rep, pharmaceutical sales and so on.

### Original NLP Problem
The problem is supervised text classification problem, and our goal is to investigate which supervised machine learning methods are best suited to solve it. Given a new job title that comes in, we want to assign it to one of 4 industry categories.
The classifier makes the assumption that each new complaint is assigned to one and only one category. This is multi-class text classification problem.

## Dataset Used
The Dataset that has two variables (Job title & Industry) in a csv format of more than 8,500 samples.

The dataset is imbalanced (Imbalance means that the number of data points available for different classes is different).
